# Do this outside your home dir, homes sometimes have restrictive rights that would block apache 
# user from writing to its file tree
#
# (unpacked size around 460MB)
git clone https://github.com/europeana/exhibitions.git

# create a mysqldb and a user (or empty it if you are reusing)

cd exhibitions
cp db.ini.sample webtree/db.ini
# edit db.ini to point to useable mysql privs


# (as root)
mkdir exhibitions/webtree/archive
chown www-data: exhibitions/webtree/archive




# store the apache.conf within the project, and do a soft-link to it from
# /etc/apache2/sites-enabled to keep everything in one place
# you obviously need to edit apache.conf before it is useable

cp apache-sample.conf apache.conf
sudo ln -s `pwd`/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/myomeka

# restart apache
# go to http://jacexhib.eanadev.org/install/
# after running install, rm -r webtree/install

# your system should now be operational!

        For a brief and brilliant period at the end of the 19th century Ð starting around 1890, and tailing off before World
        War One Ð Art Nouveau dominated the cultural scene. Everything from domestic furnishings and decorative art to
        architecture and advertising was characterised by its curvilinear elegance and organic forms inspired by nature.
        Even today, decades after the emergence of Art Nouveau, artists and designers continue to be inspired by the floral
        elements, natural features and colours of this enduring style.

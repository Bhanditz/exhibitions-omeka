	<p>Since its founding in 1934, the Institute of Ethnomusicology of the Scientific Research Centre (ZRC ) at the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts has dealt with collecting, researching, and publishing material on Slovenian folk song, music, and dance. The Institute also studies the distinguishing features of the Slovenian tradition, and how this material is connected to or differentiated from other cultures. ZRC is the only Slovenian institution to collect and store significant amounts of material on these topics. ZRC contributions to this exhibition are based on archive documentation from the Institute, prepared by Drago Kunej and Peter Vendramin with help of institute colleagues.</p>

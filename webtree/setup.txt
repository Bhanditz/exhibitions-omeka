PLUGINS:

DOCVIEWER:

This plugin has been hacked:
 - added function "getEmbed" to return embed code as a string

DocViewer should be enabled / configured.  Note that the config options "width / height" are not used, so don't need to be set.


COMMENTING:

This plugin has been hacked in the following locations:
 - CommentForm, controllers/CommentController, helpers/Commenting

The purpose of these changes is to allow users to comment without API keys or captchas.

Commenting should be configured with two checkbox ticks:
 1) User roles that can moderate: admin (check)
 2) "Allow public commenting" (check)


RESPONSIVE IMAGES:

login as admin
go to "settings" / "plugins" / "euresponsive"
define some breakpoints, ie.
	320	300
	480	460
	600	580
	960	470
click "Save Changes" (and wait until it finishes!)
